        <img src="img/Lake City.jpg" class="img-circle" alt="lake city hike">
        <p class="about">Hi There! My name is Jennifer Beem. Born and raised in a land-locked state <em>(Oklahoma)</em> where the dirt is red and the sky is big. In college I fell in love with the <strong>creative outlet</strong> that I found through materials engineering (specifically polymer chemistry and engineering). Through my engineering degree I was able to explore a mix of technical concepts and creativitiy. After three years working in industry where I developed new polymer materials for consumer use I chose to pivot my focus into programming through learning at Epicodus! Outside of my technical interests I enjoy playing the cello and all things outdoors and traveling as much as possible. This website showcases my programming learning journey - showing the progression of synax and logic learning at Epicodus!
