          <p class="about">Hi there! My name is Jennifer Beem. I was born and raised in a land-locked state where the dirt is red and the sky is huge. A few years ago I fell in love with the <strong>creative outlet</strong> that I found to exist in materials science (ever think about how all that outdoor gear is both light for ease of carrying and functional for weather protection?), which led me to study chemical engineering. After graduating from the University of Oklahoma in 2013 I spent three years working in industry where I engineered new polymer materials. I recently decided to pivot my focus into programming through Epicodus! I love <strong>all</strong> things outdoor! I cycle, hike, row, rock climb, and play the cello (almost always inside though). This website showcases my programming learning journey of syntax and logic!</p>
